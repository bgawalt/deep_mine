It sounds like "mastermind;" that's cool.

Someday, it will post an unending series of Minesweeper games to Mastodon, where
anyone listening will be able to holler new DIG and FLAG commands at the board.

For now, it just digs and flags randomly on the command line -- but importantly,
it does so while maintaining and unending history of game moves in a SQLite
table.

More details to come.
